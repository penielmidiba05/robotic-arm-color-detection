# Robotic Arm with Color Detection 🤖🎨

## 📌 Project Overview
This project consists of designing and programming a robotic arm capable of detecting the color of an object and automatically sorting it based on the detected color.

The system uses a color sensor to analyze RGB values and controls multiple servo motors to move, grab, and place objects in predefined locations.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The color sensor reads the RGB frequency values of the object.
2. The system determines the dominant color using calibrated thresholds.
3. A corresponding LED lights up to indicate the detected color.
4. The robotic arm grabs the object using a servo-controlled claw.
5. The arm moves and places the object in the appropriate area.
